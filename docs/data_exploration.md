Data Overview This project leverages publicly available Zillow Research housing market data to analyze long-term trends in U.S. home values and rental prices. The primary datasets selected for the pipeline are: ZHVI (Zillow Home Value Index – All Homes): A smoothed, seasonally adjusted measure representing the typical home value (35th–65th percentile) across regions. ZORI (Zillow Observed Rent Index – All Homes): A smoothed measure of the typical observed market rent (40th–60th percentile) across regions. Both datasets are updated monthly and provide historical coverage dating back to approximately 2000, enabling long-term time-series analysis. Zillow publishes these datasets at multiple geographic levels, including state, metro, county, city, and ZIP code, allowing analysis at both macro and micro market levels. The data is distributed as CSV files and is free for academic and non-commercial use. Data Structure & Grain Zillow Research datasets are provided in a wide-format time-series structure. Each row represents a single geographic region (e.g., one metro or one state), while each column after the region identifiers corresponds to a specific month (e.g., 2000-01-31, 2000-02-29, etc.). Key structural characteristics include: Region identifier columns (e.g., Region ID, Region Name, State, Metro) Monthly date columns containing numeric index values One dataset per metric (home value or rent) For analytical purposes, this structure implies a required transformation from wide format to long format. After transformation, the analytical grain of the data will be: One record per geographic region per month per metric Establishing this grain is critical for enabling joins across datasets (e.g., ZHVI and ZORI), performing time-series calculations, and supporting downstream analytics such as growth rates and regional comparisons. Key Insights We Can Enable Once ingested and transformed, the Zillow datasets support a range of high-value analytical insights: Home Value vs. Rent Dynamics Comparison of home value growth versus rent growth by region Identification of markets where prices are increasing faster than rents, potentially signaling affordability pressure Calculation of price-to-rent ratios as a proxy for market valuation Geographic Market Comparisons Ranking regions by home value or rent growth over time Identifying high-growth and low-growth metros or states Comparing local markets (e.g., ZIP or city level) to their broader metro or state trends Housing Tier and Market Segmentation (ZHVI) Analysis of divergence between housing tiers (e.g., top-tier vs. bottom-tier homes) Identification of regions where higher-end homes appreciate faster than lower-end homes Use of tier gaps as an indicator of housing inequality or market polarization Long-Term and Temporal Trends Examination of housing market behavior before and after major economic events (e.g., 2008 financial crisis, COVID-19 period) Detection of sustained growth, stagnation, or recovery patterns across regions Evaluation of seasonality and long-term momentum in housing markets These insights are well-suited for visualization in dashboards or for use in analytical reports and align closely with common real-world housing market questions. Implications for Pipeline Design The characteristics of the Zillow datasets directly inform the pipeline and database design: Raw Layer: Raw tables should store the Zillow data as-is, preserving the original wide-format schema and monthly columns. This ensures data fidelity and simplifies reprocessing. Transformation Layer: ETL processes will unpivot the wide-format data into a normalized long format, standardizing date and metric columns and establishing a consistent grain. Analytics Layer: Transformed tables will enable efficient time-series analysis, cross-metric joins (e.g., home values vs. rents), and aggregation across geographic levels. This separation supports a medallion-style architecture (raw → refined → analytics), improves maintainability, and ensures the pipeline can easily incorporate additional Zillow datasets or geographic levels in the future. Overall, this exploration clarifies both the analytical potential of the Zillow data and the architectural decisions required to support scalable, insight-driven analysis.
