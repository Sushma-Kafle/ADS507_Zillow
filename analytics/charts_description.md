# Metabase Analytics – Zillow Housing Pipeline
#http://localhost:3000/collection/root

This document summarizes the four required visualizations built in Metabase using the transformed data marts generated by the Airflow ETL pipeline.

The data originates from Zillow Research (ZHVI and ZORI datasets), is processed through raw, staging, and mart layers in PostgreSQL, and visualized using Metabase.

## Time Series of Home Values by Metro Region
**Table Used:** mart_housing_time_series  
**Visualization:** Line Chart  

This chart displays the trend of average home values over time by Metro Region.

- X-axis: Date  
- Y-axis: Average home_value  
- Series: Metro Region  

**Insight:**  
This visualization highlights long-term appreciation patterns and cyclical trends in housing markets across Metro Region. It allows comparison of growth trajectories and volatility between regions.

##  Price-to-Rent Ratio by Metro Region (Map)
**Table Used:** mart_housing_time_series  
**Visualization:** Geographic Map  

This map shows the average price-to-rent ratio for each Metro Region.

- Aggregation: Average price_to_rent_ratio  
- Grouped by: Metro Region  

**Insight:**  
Higher ratios may indicate markets where buying is relatively more expensive compared to renting, while lower ratios suggest more rental affordability relative to purchase prices. This metric helps assess housing market balance.

## Year-over-Year Home Value Growth by Metro Region
**Table Used:** mart_housing_growth  
**Visualization:** Bar Chart  

This chart presents the average year-over-year percentage growth in home values by Metro Region.

- X-axis: Metro Region  
- Y-axis: Average home_value_yoy_growth  

**Insight:**  
This chart enables quick identification of high-growth versus slow-growth markets and highlights regional momentum shifts in housing value appreciation.

## Home Value vs Rent Value Scatter Plot
**Table Used:** mart_housing_time_series  
**Visualization:** Scatter Plot  

This scatter plot compares average home values against average rent values by Metro Region.

- X-axis: Average home_value  
- Y-axis: Average rent_value  

**Insight:**  
The scatter plot illustrates correlation between housing prices and rental prices. Metro Region with higher home values typically show higher rent values, indicating strong positive correlation between ownership and rental markets.

## Pipeline Architecture Overview

1. Extract ZHVI and ZORI datasets from local mounted CSV files.
2. Load raw data into PostgreSQL (raw layer).
3. Transform into long format and calculate derived metrics.
4. Build mart tables:
   - mart_housing_time_series
   - mart_housing_growth
5. Visualize results in Metabase.

This workflow demonstrates a complete modern data pipeline:
Docker → Airflow → PostgreSQL → Analytics Layer → BI Visualization.
